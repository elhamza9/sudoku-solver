## Sudoku Solver

This is a simple Golang recursion-based implementation of a sudoku solver.

(this is part of my path to learn the Golang language)

- pkg/ directory contains the library code for solving a sudoku puzzle.
- cmd/ contains an example of terminal-based interactive program that uses the library to solve a given puzzle.
